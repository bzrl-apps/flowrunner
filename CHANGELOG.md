## [1.0.0](https://github.com/bzrl-apps/flowrunner/compare/v0.11.0...v1.0.0) (2022-06-07)


### ‚ö† BREAKING CHANGES

* **job:** Task result structure got changed when using with loop.
Loop task now has status, error & output fields as a normal task. So
array of item results is moved to output.
* **core:** flows accessing to exchanged message content such as data,
source, uuid etc. need to be changed. For ex: replace
`context.msg_id.data.event` instead of `context.data.event` when using
kafka source.
